# Secure-and-share-Govt-Document-with-Family-Members

Problem Statement:
Citizens will be able to keep documents such as mark sheets, PAN cards,
passports, and other important documents in digital format as a result of this
advancement. Simultaneously, it aims to cut government spending, lowering the
government's overhead costs. It will lessen the risks of losing crucial documents by
linking each member's Adhaar number, which is a unique number given to all
cardholders. The internet system allows you to share them. Physical copies of
documents will become obsolete in the near future. It will provide services in all
main categories, including education, health care, railroads, and other specifics.
